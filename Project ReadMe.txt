1. When installing the files make sure you ether update this if you already have it by replacing the old files with the new ones. 
npm update or npm install i believe is the start of this.

2. npm start will begin the loading of the page. 

3.  This project was mainly about making it easier to do two things. Making basic advanced searchign easier within the store. This was done by adding a simple advanced option
under the initial search bar. The biggest change of all was to get one of its biggest sales points out there and easier to find, we added Steam Greenlight to the top.  
Initially trying to find this is a major pain in the neck, by adding it to the top we can not go directly to it itself and see all the extra games the small time developers
work on. I have several myself from Greenlight, some of my favorite are from there even over the bigger games like Total War rome 2 by paradox interactive.
